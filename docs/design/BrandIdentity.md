# Typography System

## Font Pairing (Recommended)

Primary: Inter (or system sans-serif stack)  
Fallback: ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont

## Headings

- H1: text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold tracking-tight
- H2: text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold
- H3: text-lg font-semibold

Headings should feel compact and strong, not airy.

## Body Text

- text-base md:text-lg
- text-gray-600 (on light)
- text-gray-200 (on dark)

Line height: relaxed but not loose (leading-relaxed)

---

# Spacing System

Use consistent vertical rhythm:

- Section padding: py-24 (desktop), py-16 (mobile)
- Container width: max-w-6xl
- Horizontal padding: px-6
- Grid gap: gap-10

Avoid cramped layouts.
Avoid oversized SaaS-style whitespace.

# Button System

## Primary Button (Dark Background)

- bg-white
- text-black
- shadow-sm
- hover:scale-[1.03]
- transition-transform

## Secondary Button

- border border-white/70 (on dark)
- border border-slate-300 (on light)
- subtle hover background

Buttons should feel calm and solid — not flashy.

---

# Map Styling Guidance

Use muted dark Mapbox style:

- Dark base
- Subtle road labels
- Desaturated colors
- No bright marker pins

Cluster markers should be minimal:

- Soft white or slate tones
- No aggressive red markers

---

# Motion & Interaction Rules

- Use subtle fade-ins (opacity transitions)
- Use scale 1.02–1.03 on hover
- Avoid bounce, elastic, or dramatic motion
- No heavy parallax

Movement should feel deliberate and restrained.

---

# Visual Principles

1. The map is the product.
2. Data first, decoration second.
3. Neutral language builds trust.
4. Restraint increases credibility.
5. Every design choice should support seriousness.
